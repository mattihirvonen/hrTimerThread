This hrTimer test bench is ispired from "rt-tests" tool set how to make (soft) real time
thread system into Linux application. Hearth of timing scheduler thread function quite
similar as in "cyclictest" application.

- sudo apt install rt-tests
- sudo cyclictest -l100000 -m -S -p90 -i1000 -h1000 -q > output.txt

There are mo odd things

- cyclictest gives average latency is < 60 us (with original Raspi (1) and BeagleBone AI)
- hrTimer gives average latency < 150 us
- cyclic test worst case latency is < 1 ms
- hrTimer test worst case latency is randomly even 10 ... 15 ms (not often but still some)
